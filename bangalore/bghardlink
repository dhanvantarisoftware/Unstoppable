Bangalore has a lot of institutions and a lot of smart individuals, and it’s also a big city, therefore there are a lot of traffic issues. This traffic issue causes a significant traffic congestion that may last up to 4-5 hours each day.

This traffic issue is becoming more severe as time passes; there are many high-volume cars and insufficient infrastructure, and this illogical distribution of growth may contribute to the city’s increased traffic congestion.

The primary source of traffic has been because many people reside there, and as the city’s population grows, so do the number of cars that run through the roads, creating traffic jams.

People from the city prefer to go by car since our nation is a running metropolis, and autos pollute the environment.
